## 🔧 How to Setup the Project (Step-by-Step)

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [x] Java JDK (8 or higher)
- [x] NetBeans IDE
- [x] MySQL or XAMPP with phpMyAdmin
- [x] Git (optional, for cloning repository)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

You can download the zip or clone the project using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

---

### 2. Open Project in NetBeans

1. Open **NetBeans IDE**
2. Click on `File > Open Project`
3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned/downloaded the project
4. Select the project folder and click **Open**

---

### 3. Set Up the MySQL Database

#### Method 1: Using phpMyAdmin (XAMPP)

1. Start **XAMPP** and open **phpMyAdmin**
2. Create a new database (e.g., `java_app_db`)
3. Click **Import**, then select the SQL file located in the `database/` folder of the project
4. Click **Go** to import

#### Method 2: Using MySQL CLI

```sql
CREATE DATABASE java_app_db;
USE java_app_db;
-- Paste contents of the SQL file here or use source command
SOURCE path/to/database.sql;
```

---

### 4. Update Database Connection in Code

Open your Java DB connection class (usually named `DBConnection.java` or similar), and update the credentials:

```java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/java_app_db";
String username = "root"; // or your MySQL user
String password = "";     // use your MySQL password if any
```

Make sure your MySQL server is running before launching the app.

---

### 5. Run the Application

1. In NetBeans, find the main class containing the `public static void main(String[] args)` method
2. Right-click the file and select **Run File**
3. The Java Swing application window should launch

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- **Error: `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver not found`**
  - Make sure you've added the MySQL JDBC connector `.jar` file to the project libraries in NetBeans.
- **Blank GUI**
  - Ensure the database is running and credentials are correct.
- **Can't connect to database**
  - Check if MySQL is running and port is correct (default is 3306).
